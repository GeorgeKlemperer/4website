    <p> Hi! My name is George, welcome to my website which is also my application project for the Founders and Coders software development apprenticeship. My background up until now has mostly been in science and academia. I completed a master's in Chemistry at the University of Bristol, where I then went on to do a PhD in Synthetic Biology. During my PhD I spent a year at the University of Oxford where I performed research that went on to be part of a publication in <i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-020-0444-1">Nature Chemistry</a></i>. After finishing my PhD I continued as a postdoctural research assistant in the University of Bristol's Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine working on 3D bioprinting. Here I performed my own research as well as well as helped PhD students on their own projects. After this I took a year out to go travelling, which included a 6-week cycling tour around France and along the Pyrenees, and a long trip to visit the Philippines (where I was born). <br><br>
    
    In my spare time I greatly enjoy staying active. I play tennis, squash, and football (and for my sins, support Tottenham). I run when its not wet, and boulder when it is. At university I also did Brazilian jiu jitsu for 3 years. I also love to read, and listen to music.

    <br><br>
    I have also been a bartender in two different major cities in the UK, been employed as a freelance writer for a music review site, crashed a moped, once cycled 200 km in a day, and own a signed Ryley Walker poster. My favourite colour is orange, sometimes blue.
